An experiment with [contact printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_print). Some of this 16mm film was shot using a camera, but most was exposed by laying the film out on the floor of a pitch dark room, placing items on it, and manually exposing it piece-by-piece with a flashlight.

Made for a handmade film class.
