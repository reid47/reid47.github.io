title: About me
---

I’m a software engineer and filmmaker currently living in San Francisco. I’m passionate about education, accessibility, and building experiences that make people's lives a little easier or a little more enjoyable. My pronouns are he/him/his.

These days, I’m especially interested in front-end web development (JavaScript, React, etc), building accessible user interfaces, and programming language design (compiler-writing, type-checking, etc).

Prior to entering the real world, I grew up in a suburb of New York and went to school at Pomona College, where I majored in computer science and media studies.

I currently work at Pivotal Software, where I'm helping to build [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/). Before that, I worked at Microsoft.
