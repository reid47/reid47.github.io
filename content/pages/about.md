Hi, I'm Reid!

I'm a software engineer and filmmaker currently living in San Francisco, CA. I'm passionate about creating things that make people's lives a little easier or a little more enjoyable. My pronouns are he/him/his.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reidmitchell/) or maybe [Twitter](https://twitter.com/r3idm). Some of my projects are up on [GitHub](https://github.com/reid47).
