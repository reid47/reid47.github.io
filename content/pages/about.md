Hi, I'm Reid! I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco, CA. I'm passionate about building accessible, delightful experiences that enrich people's lives, whether that's through coding, storytelling, good design, or any other means.

I grew up in a suburb of New York, and I attended [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/) in Claremont, CA, where I majored in computer science and media studies. My pronouns are he/his.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reidmitchell/) or maybe [Twitter](https://twitter.com/r3idm). Some of my projects are up on [GitHub](https://github.com/reid47).
