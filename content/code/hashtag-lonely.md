On the internet, nobody can see your face. Nobody can know how you are feeling or what you are doing unless you decide to broadcast it. Some choose to hide their emotions online. These people use the internet as a shield, a disguise, and escape into anonymity. Others choose instead to exaggerate their feelings, to project caricatures of themselves that play up their unhappiness for sympathy and their excitement for validation. Seeking human connection in this way can make people dependent on the attention of those around them for fulfillment.

This project explores that concept in a robot which is incapable of physically showing emotion. It looks around the room for friends, but its face is permanently blank. It grows lonelier with every second that it doesn't see anyone, but it can only express this by complaining on Twitter. When someone does approach it, it takes a picture and shares it on Twitter to show the world that it does have friends. Its loneliness is temporarily relieved, but within a minute it is whining again. As these cycles of extreme emotion continue, the disconnect between the robotâ€™s volatile online persona and its stoic physical presence becomes more and more apparent.

Although the installation is no longer active, you can still check out the robot's Twitter feed: [@hashtag_lonely](https://twitter.com/hashtag_lonely).

The code was written in [Processing](https://processing.org/), talking to an Arduino that powered the robot's movements and using the Twitter API to make posts.
