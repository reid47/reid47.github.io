With A2B, I designed the user experience and user interface for a travel app that would eliminate the frustrating or painful parts of travel planning. As the sole designer on the project, I did the research, prototyping, testing, and final wireframes over the course of three weeks.

## The idea

I started with a hypothesis. People love to dream of taking vacations. We have fun coming up with what these trips might look like: where we'll go, what we'll eat, what we'll do. But when we get the chance to actually take the trip, the planning and logistics can quickly suck the fun out of it.

A2B tries to solve this problem. How might an app let someone focus 100% on the fun parts of planning, while taking care of the annoying parts instantly?

## The research

To validate the hypothesis, I crafted a proto-persona that represented what I imagined the app's target user to be. She was aged 23, tech-savvy, and recently started working full-time. She had always dreamed of traveling the world, but never had the resources until now. She'd like to use some of her newfound income and her vacation days to finally explore the world.

I interviewed 5 people who roughly fit the demographic of my proto-persona, all based in San Francisco, and I sent a survey out via social media to collect a lot of data about people's travel planning habits. The questions generally focused on **identifying which parts of travel planning are fun, and which parts were painful**.

The results were surprisingly consistent: When planning a trip, people loved to research things to do in their destinations (searching the internet, making must-see lists, asking others for recommendations, starting group chats with friends, etc). But the least-fun parts were all logistical: booking travel, figuring out how to get between places in their destination, and ensuring that they were scheduling their days efficiently. There was a general feeling that **it is hard to make the most of a person's limited time in a new city**.

## The persona

Based on these findings, I developed a final persona, named Angela, who was quite similar to my proto-persona. She was most interested in visiting European cities, especially Paris. The most notable difference from my proto-persona was her focus on traveling with friends. She often traveled in groups, and she had felt a lot of pain around making sure everyone in her group's preferences were honored when planning these trips.

## Wireframing & testing

I set out to design a basic user flow that captured the core functionality of the app. It would let you create a new trip with a destination city, add sights to see and meals to eat, and then would **automatically suggest an itinerary**, based on your configured preferences. If you didn't like the suggested itinerary, you would "shuffle" it to get a new suggestion.

The first round of designs were simple wireframe sketches. These screens covered all of the steps in that user flow, as well as some onboarding steps.

After doing some usability testing with these, I built a set of low-fidelity digital wireframes in Adobe XD. I made these screens into a clickable prototype and did another round of usability testing.

## Final prototype

In the end, I built my high-fidelity clickable prototype in Figma. I developed a simple style guide using Figma components to keep the design consistent, and I relied heavily on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for free images.

## Conclusions

The feedback I received on the final prototype was generally positive, but there are several pieces I'd develop further in a future iteration. Specifically, I'd like to think harder about the "edit trip details" workflow (not fully built-out in the prototype), and I'd like to do another round of research focused on the itinerary generation feature: Is the "Shuffle" button clear? Is there a way to make it more useful?
