These three videos were made on [Super 8mm film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_8_film) and hand-developed/hand-scratched/hand-colored. I made them for a class called Handmade Film, in which we were encouraged to experiment with different ways to intervene upon the film before and after developing it.

The process involved shooting some footage, developing it in a darkroom, cutting/rearranging/scratching the film strips, digitizing the footage with a [telecine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine) machine, and then doing final editing and sound design with Adobe Premiere. I had never done anything quite like this before, and I had a ton of fun making mistakes in the process. I ended up with three pieces that I'm proud of.

## Evolution

While shooting my first project, the film broke inside the camera. This ruined most of the footage, but the salvageable parts had some really interesting double-exposures. Since I couldn't use most of what I shot, I abandoned my original plan and turned it into a meditation on adapting to overcome obstacles.

## Erasure

For my second film, I wanted to explore more hand-scratching and hand-coloring. This one required many hours hunched over the tiny 8mm film strips, scratching with needles and drawing with markers. When each frame is so small, it's tough to know if what you're doing is going to turn out well until you're done. But it mostly worked out! Plus, my footage came out pretty clear, so I could tell the story I'd envisioned.

## Contact

For my final project, I mostly used [contact printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_print) instead of shooting with a camera. This meant that I sealed myself in a pitch-dark room, laid out unexposed film on the ground, and carefully exposed parts of the film piece-by-piece using a flashlight. I put different objects and textures between my light and the film to achieve different effects.

This one was especially difficult, since it was often hard to make sure the film, objects, and light were lined up correctly until I turned on the light... and by then, the film was exposed, and it was too late! Still, I'm pleased with how it turned out.
