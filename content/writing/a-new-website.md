Welcome to my new website!

After several years of designing and redesigning, building and rebuilding, deleting and recreating my personal website an absurd number of times (30?), all without ever putting any real content on it, I have decided that enough is enough. I'm settling on a simple design and an easy-to-use framework for building the site (more on that in [this post]({{< relref "/writing/how-i-built-this-site.md" >}})!), so I can focus on what should really be the most important thing: **the content**.

With this site, I hope to give something back to the online communities that have taught me so much over the years. I've learned a ton from tutorials, blog posts, videos, etc., and I want to be able to help others learn in the same way. I'll do my best to share any interesting and/or helpful things that I come across.

Thanks for reading! Stay tuned!
