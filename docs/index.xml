      <description>So, you want to build a website, but you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start.
Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard something about HTML, but you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure what it is. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of it. Either way, this post will help you get started building websites!
What is a website? A website is just a bunch of files, like the files on your computer. Each file is made up of some text that tells your browser (e.</description>

      <description>On the internet, nobody can see your face. Nobody can know how you are feeling or what you are doing unless you decide to broadcast it. Some choose to hide their emotions online. These people use the internet as a shield, a disguise, and escape into anonymity. Others choose instead to exaggerate their feelings, to project caricatures of themselves that play up their unhappiness for sympathy and their excitement for validation.</description>

      <title>Wrapping your head around recursion</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with an analogy.
Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re standing in a long line of people waiting for something on a very foggy day. It&amp;rsquo;s so foggy that nobody in line can see further than one person ahead of them and one person behind them. You certainly can&amp;rsquo;t see the beginning of the line. But you&amp;rsquo;re growing impatient, so you would like to know your position in the line. Are you 5th or 500th?</description>

      <title>How I built this site</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated by the different technologies, languages, and methods people use to build websites. When I see a website I admire, I often spend time digging to see how it was built. So, I wanted to share the details behind how this site is made.
There are tons of great options out there for this kind of thing, all with different strengths: Wordpress, Jekyll, Hexo, to name just a few.</description>

      <title>A new website (finally!)</title>

      <description>Welcome to my new website!
After several years of designing and redesigning, building and rebuilding, deleting and recreating my personal website an absurd number of times (30?), all without ever putting any real content on it, I have decided that enough is enough. I&amp;rsquo;m settling on a simple design and an easy-to-use framework for building the site (more on that in this post!), so I can focus on what should really be the most important thing: the content.</description>

      <description>An experiment with contact printing. Some of this 16mm film was shot using a camera, but most was exposed by laying the film out on the floor of a pitch dark room, placing items on it, and manually exposing it piece-by-piece with a flashlight.

      <description>An experiment in hand-scratched, hand-colored 16mm film. Shot, developed, and then intervened upon to give the effect you see here.

      <title>Evolution</title>

      <description>My first experiment with 16mm film. My original plan for this was quite different from what you see here, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite know what I was doing with the camera, so I only got a small amount of usable footage. The piece then evolved to be about its own evolution into something (sort of) watchable.
