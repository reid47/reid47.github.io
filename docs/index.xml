      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Reid! I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer living in San Francisco, CA. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about building accessible, delightful experiences that enrich people&amp;rsquo;s lives, whether that&amp;rsquo;s through coding, storytelling, good design, or any other means.
I grew up in a suburb of New York, and I attended Pomona College in Claremont, CA, where I majored in computer science and media studies. My pronouns are he/his.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to get in touch, you can find me on LinkedIn or maybe Twitter.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new website!
After several years of designing and redesigning, building and rebuilding, deleting and recreating my personal website an absurd number of times (30?), all without ever putting any real content on it, I have decided that enough is enough. I&amp;rsquo;m settling on a simple design and an easy-to-use framework for building the site (more on that to come in a future post!), so I can focus on what should really be the most important thing: the content.</description>
