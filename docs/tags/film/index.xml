      <description>An experiment with contact printing. Some of this 16mm film was shot using a camera, but most was exposed by laying the film out on the floor of a pitch dark room, placing items on it, and manually exposing it piece-by-piece with a flashlight.

      <description>An experiment in hand-scratched, hand-colored 16mm film. Shot, developed, and then intervened upon to give the effect you see here.

      <description>My first experiment with 16mm film. My original plan for this was quite different from what you see here, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite know what I was doing with the camera, so I only got a small amount of usable footage. The piece then evolved to be about its own evolution into something (sort of) watchable.
