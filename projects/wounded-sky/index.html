  <p>I made this music video for Ruby Reilly&rsquo;s original song &ldquo;Wounded Sky.&rdquo; Check out more of Ruby&rsquo;s music <a href="https://rubyreilly.bandcamp.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ruby is from my hometown. I was home from college for Christmas break, I had recently acquired a Super 8mm film camera from a garage sale, and I loved Ruby&rsquo;s music. I felt this song especially could fit with the analog film aesthetic, so we set out to make this video happen.</p>

<p>I had never shot a film camera before. At first, I wasn&rsquo;t even sure if the camera worked; I had to take it to a camera repair shop where they scrubbed old battery acid out of it. But we got it working!</p>

<p>I bought two 50&rsquo; reels of film, which gave us about 7 minutes of footage total. Since the song is almost 5 minutes long, we were lucky that most of the footage turned out usable.</p>

<p>After getting the film developed, I didn&rsquo;t have the equipment (or experience) to splice the film by hand. I wanted to digitize it so I could edit on my computer with Final Cut Pro. Plus, we would need to add the digital audio at some point anyway.</p>

<p>To do the digitizing, I borrowed a projector and projected the film against my bedroom wall so I could record it with a digital camera. Here&rsquo;s a picture:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wounded-sky-projection.jpg" alt="footage projected onto my wall" /></p>

<p>This was a ton of fun. I accidentally burned up some of the film by leaving it too close to the bulb for too long, but I got all of it onto my computer.</p>

<p>At the very end of the video, you can see some actual footage of the film burning up as I recorded. And I incorporated the real sounds of me turning the projector on and off. I was really happy with the effects that these created.</p>
