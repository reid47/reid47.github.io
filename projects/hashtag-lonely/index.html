  <h1>Hashtag Lonely</h1>

  <p>I built a robot that complains on Twitter until you pay attention to it. When you do, it takes your picture and posts it to Twitter. But after this brief moment of happiness, it&rsquo;s back to complaining again.</p>

<p>The robot is powered by an Arduino running some <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> code that uses <a href="https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing">OpenCV</a> for face detection and the Twitter API for posting online.</p>

<p>This was my final project for a class called Robotics, Digital Media, &amp; the Environment. We showed our work in a student gallery at the end of the semester, which is where the video below was shot. You can see its real tweets here: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag_lonely">@hashtag_lonely</a>.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/93522322"
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" webkitallowfullscreen

</div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the statement I wrote about it for the showing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the internet, nobody can see your face. Nobody can know how you are feeling or what you are doing unless you decide to broadcast it. Some choose to hide their emotions online. These people use the internet as a shield, a disguise, and escape into anonymity. Others choose instead to exaggerate their feelings, to project caricatures of themselves that play up their unhappiness for sympathy and their excitement for validation. Seeking human connection in this way can make people dependent on the attention of those around them for fulfillment.</p>

<p>This project explores that concept in a robot which is incapable of physically showing emotion. It looks around the room for friends, but its face is permanently blank. It grows lonelier with every second that it doesn&rsquo;t see anyone, but it can only express this by complaining on Twitter. When someone does approach it, it takes a picture and shares it on Twitter to show the world that it does have friends. Its loneliness is temporarily relieved, but within a minute it is whining again. As these cycles of extreme emotion continue, the disconnect between the robot’s volatile online persona and its stoic physical presence becomes more and more apparent.</p>
