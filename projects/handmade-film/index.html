  <h1>Handmade film</h1>

  

<p>These three videos were made on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_8_film">Super 8mm film</a> and hand-developed/hand-scratched/hand-colored. I made them for a class called Handmade Film, in which we were encouraged to experiment with different ways to intervene upon the film before and after developing it.</p>

<p>The process generally involved shooting some footage, developing it in a darkroom, cutting/rearranging/scratching the film strips somehow, digitizing the footage with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine">telecine</a> machine, and then doing final editing and sound design with Adobe Premiere. I had never done anything quite like this before, and I had a ton of fun making mistakes in the process. I ended up with three pieces that I&rsquo;m proud of.</p>

<h2 id="evolution">Evolution</h2>

<p>While shooting my first project, the film broke inside the camera. This ruined most of the footage, but the salvageable parts had some really interesting double-exposures. Since I couldn&rsquo;t use most of what I shot, I abandoned my original plan and turned it into a meditation on adapting to overcome obstacles.</p>

<h2 id="erasure">Erasure</h2>

<p>For my second film, I wanted to explore more hand-scratching and hand-coloring. This one required many hours hunched over the tiny 8mm film strips, scratching with needles and drawing with markers. When each frame is so small, it&rsquo;s tough to know if what you&rsquo;re doing is going to turn out well until you&rsquo;re done. But it mostly worked out! Plus, my footage came out pretty clear, so I could tell the story I&rsquo;d envisioned.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>For my final project, I mostly used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_print">contact printing</a> instead of shooting with a camera. This meant that I sealed myself in a pitch-dark room, laid out unexposed film on the ground, and carefully exposed parts of the film piece-by-piece using a flashlight. I put different objects and textures between my light and the film to achieve different effects.</p>

<p>This one was especially difficult, since it was often hard to make sure the film, objects, and light were lined up correctly until I turned on the light&hellip; and by then, the film was exposed, and it was too late! Still, I&rsquo;m pleased with how it turned out.</p>
