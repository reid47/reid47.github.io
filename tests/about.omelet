        Hi, I'm Reid. I'm passionate about writing code, designing websites, and making
        movies &mdash; and teaching others about all of those things. I have learned so much
        from online blogs and tutorials over the years that I feel it is only right to
        try to give something back to the internet community. So I hope that you find
        something on here that's helpful, or at least interesting.

        Some background about me: I'm currently working as a software engineer and
        living in Seattle, WA. In 2016, I graduated from Pomona College in
        Claremont, CA, where I majored in computer science and media studies. Before college,
        I grew up in the suburbs of New York, a few miles north of New York City.
