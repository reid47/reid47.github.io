  Hi, I'm Reid. I'm passionate about writing code, designing websites, and making
  movies &mdash; and teaching others about all of those things. I have learned so much
  from online blogs and tutorials over the years that I feel it is only right to
  try to give something back to the internet community. So I hope that you find
  something on here that's helpful, or at least interesting.
</p>
<p>
  Some background about me: I'm currently working as a software engineer and
  living in Seattle, WA. In 2016, I graduated from Pomona College in
  Claremont, CA, where I majored in computer science and media studies. Before college,
  I grew up in the suburbs of New York, a few miles north of New York City.
