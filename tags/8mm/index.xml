      <description>These three videos were made on Super 8mm film and hand-developed/hand-scratched/hand-colored. I made them for a class called Handmade Film, in which we were encouraged to experiment with different ways to intervene upon the film before and after developing it.
The process involved shooting some footage, developing it in a darkroom, cutting/rearranging/scratching the film strips, digitizing the footage with a telecine machine, and then doing final editing and sound design with Adobe Premiere.</description>
