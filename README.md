# reidmitchell.net

These are the files for my personal website, which you can see live at [reidmitchell.net](http://reidmitchell.net).

The pages were written in [Omelet](https://github.com/reid47/omelet), the front-end language that I've been working on for the past year or so. I encourage you to take a look at the Omelet files (ending in `.omelet`) to see how it works. They were compiled into HTML with the simple script `make.js`, which pretty much just runs `omelet.renderFile()` on each file that I want to compile. This site is the most complete (and currently only) living example of Omelet in the wild!
